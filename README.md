# Decoding Language File from Mario 64 (Switch)

An attempt to decode the language translation file, Messages.bin, from the game `Mario 64`, specifically the Nintendo Switch version included in `'Super Mario 3D All-Stars'`.

The file in question is: 010049900F546001\romfs\Message\EUen\Messages.bin

The header has not been decoded yet; only the text starting from address 0x000009B0 has been analyzed.

This is still in the early stages, so donâ€™t expect much...
